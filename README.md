## 🧠 Brain-tumor-classification-using-CNN

This project focuses on classifying brain tumors from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The dataset used comprises 7,023 MRI images categorized into four distinct classes:

• Glioma: Cancerous brain tumors in glial cells.
• Meningioma: Non-cancerous tumors originating from the meninges.
• No Tumor: Normal brain scans without detectable tumors.
• Pituitary: Tumors affecting the pituitary gland, which can be cancerous or non-cancerous.
